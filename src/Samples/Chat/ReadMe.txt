how to implement messaging between nodes.  Many features could be added including groups.

The program starts up and adds itself to the list of nodes available for chatting.  As
new nodes enter the network, they are added to everyones list.  As nodes leave the network,
they are removed from everyones list.  You can broadcast messages to all nodes or send messages
directly to a specific node.
